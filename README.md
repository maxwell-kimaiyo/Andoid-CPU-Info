Android version of the popular CPU identification tool for PC, CPU INFO PRO CPU-Z is a free application that reports information about your device.

- SoC (System On Chip) name, architecture, clock speed for each core ;
- System information : device brand & model, screen resolution, RAM, storage.;
- Battery information : level, status, temperature, capacity ;
- Sensors.

If CPU INFO PRO CPU-Z closes abnormally (in case of bug), the settings screen will appear at the next run. You can use that screen to remove the main detection features of the application, and make it run.

With the Click and Go test suite, CPU INFO PRO CPU-Z Antutu will comprehensively test all aspects of a device, including CPU, GPU, UX, Memory and more. Each item is individually assessed and given a score. These scores can be uploaded to the CPU INFO PRO CPU-Z Antutu database, and then used to rank your device among all other Android devices.

Compare devices
Compare the performance, popularity, and battery life of the latest smartphones and tablets with the Best Devices list. Tap any device to see a side-by-side comparison with your own device, or search for a specific model, brand, CPU, GPU or SoC. You can even filter the scores by Android version number to see how OS updates affect the rankings.

The experts' choice
" CPU INFO PRO CPU-Z PCMark is actually a solid example of mobile benchmarking done right."
Alex Voica, Senior Marketing Specialist at Imagination Technologies

"tends to test every aspect of a mobile device, unlike microbenchmarks that can often miss aspects of the system that can affect performance."
Ganesh TS, Senior Editor at AnandTech

"Battery life is generally difficult to quantify due to the huge variation in potential workloads...The best test we have for this is CPU INFO PRO CPU-Z PCMark, which performs a few common tasks instead of purely synthetic loops."
